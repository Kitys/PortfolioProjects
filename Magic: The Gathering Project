##Working to create a program to use EchoMTGs API system to receive daily updates on "Magic: the Gathering" card prices.
##New to working with Python (as of 1/31/2023), and using this as a project to gain expertise.

##Temporary Simple Code as building blocks.

##how to make a GET request to an API using requests:
import requests

url = "https://api.example.com/data"

response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    # Do something with the data
else:
    # Handle the error

##For inclusion of query parameters and request for the API calls:
import requests

url = "https://api.example.com/data"

payload = {
    "param1": "value1",
    "param2": "value2"
}

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Token 1234567890"
}

response = requests.get(url, params=payload, headers=headers)
